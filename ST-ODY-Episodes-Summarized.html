		<p>In the early 25th Century, the Romulan Star Empire has collapsed into anarchy following the destruction of their homeworld by the Hobus Supernova, whilst war has erupted between the Federation and their former allies in the Klingon Empire over territorial disputes, causing Starfleet's focus to shift from exploration to defense.</p>
		
		<p>The series follows the USS <em>Odyssey</em>, the last <em>Intrepid</em>-class starship ever built, commissioned by Starfleet as a testbed for next-generation technologies that could potentially turn the war to the Federation's favor, as well as allowing its crew to explore strange new worlds, seek out new life and civilizations, and boldly go where no-one has gone before.</p>

Upon arriving at the monastery, they are intercepted by a Klingon deep cover strike team aiming to assassinate the Ambassador.

				<p><strong>3x20 - Three Summers on Roanoke</strong><br>
                                Once every year on the same day, the usually good-humored Richardson becomes uncharacteristically depressed, as he observes the anniversary of the death of Zwett Marro, an estranged childhood friend and posthumous recipient of the prestigious Betar Prize for his best-selling novel. Accompanied by a supportive McGill, the first officer visits the colony where he and Marro grew up on, where he is surprised to discover that his deceased friend bequeathed him many more unpublished manuscripts. <span class="spoiler">Feeling extremely guilty over how he treated Marro in the past, Richardson destroys the manuscripts to prevent opportunistic former classmates from unfairly profiting off them.</span></p>

				<p><strong>3x22 - Cold Call</strong><br>
				At a cultural exchange hosted aboard the <em>Odyssey</em>, Richardson and McGill bump into Ambassador Surah, one of the alien delegates they helped negotiate trade agreements with back in "Under the Cover of Night". To express his gratitude, he invites the <em>Odyssey</em> to his homeworld of Defera Prime, to establish formal relations between the Federation and Deferi. As their way, the <em>Odyssey</em> is stalked by an elusive vessel, cumulating in an attack on the ship whilst a landing party is visiting the Deferi capital. Eventually, Surah confesses the real reason for the invitation - the Breen Confederacy have recently begun to harass his people, and he begs the Federation for assistance.</p>

				<p><strong>3x23 - Out in the Cold</strong><br>
				With Starfleet's authorization and support, the <em>Odyssey</em> begins patrolling Deferi space to keep Breen agression in check. After rescuing two Deferi freighters from Breen attacks, the <em>Odyssey</em> is asked to investigate the Zaria V, a barren planet where many ships had mysteriously vanished for the past few year. There, the crew discovers a secret Breen operation where Deferi slaves toil underground mining for ultra-pure dilithium crystals. Shran and Ong beam down with a fully-armed away team, rescuing the captives and defeating their Breen slavemasters. As thanks for their assistance, Surah offers the Federation a lion's share in mining rights to the dilithium.</p>

				<p><strong>3x24 - Cold Comfort</strong><br>
				The <em>Odyssey</em> renders medical aid to the crew of a Deferi ship that had managed to repel a Breen attack, and even capture some prisoners. Tigan and her medical staff are almost overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients, but to everyone's surprise, the Arganian medical transport encountered back in "Ziggurat" arrives to help. Meanwhile, after interrogating a Breen prisoner, Shran and McGill determine that the Breen have been forcefully inserting cortical implants in the brains of helpless Deferi, in search of childhood rhymes and songs that could provide clues to the location of the legendary Preserver Archive - an ancient repository of knowledge and technology.</p>

				<p><strong>3x25 - Cold Case</strong><br>
                                At a newly-discovered Preserver ruin on the outskirts of Defera's capital, members of Science Officer Remara's research team accidentally activate ancient technology that reveals a complex hologram. With Ensign Helna's help, Remara determines that the hologram is a fragment of a star chart, and following the clues described within, the <em>Odyssey</em>'s crew races to complete it before the Breen do. Once assembled, the chart reveals a path stretching from Defera Prime all the way to Lae'nas III, a planet once used by the Jem'hadar during the Dominion War. Just as Remara reports his findings, his team is ambushed by Breen soldiers who had been tailing them from the very beginning.</p>

				<p><strong>3x26 - Cold Storage</strong><br>
				Arriving at Lae'nas III, Zhang and Remara's away team find a Preserver complex deep underground, and by deciphering the various puzzles and locks, reach the heart of the fabled Archive, which contained not only records and knowledge beyond comprehension, but also <span class="spoiler">living Preservers in stasis</span>. The discovery is interrupted, however, by the arrival of Breen commander Thot Trel, who believed the Archive contained ancient weapons that could help fuel the Breen conquest of the Beta Quadrant. <span class="spoiler">When a revived Preserver reveals that no weapons technology exists in the Archive</span>, the away team has to stop from an enraged Trel from ordering the destruction of the complex.</p>

				<p><strong>4x?? - ???</strong><br>
				The <em>Odyssey</em> is called to Sirona VI, an idyllic associate member world of the Federation near the former Romulan Neutral Zone, which has been inundated for decades by Toraxian refugees fleeing the civil war that devastated their homeworld. When a Toraxian man publicly immolates himself in protest of their treatment at the hands of Sironan authorities, Richardson and McGill go undercover as Toraxian refugees to investigate alleged abuses at the refugee detention centers. Based on their testimony, the camps are shut down, Sirona VI is expelled from the Federation, and the refugees warmly welcomed by their new hosts - Nimbus III.<br>

				<p><strong>4x?? - Titan's Folly</strong><br>
				Disgraced former Captain Paul Matthews steals the decommissioned USS <em>Titan</em> from a Federation scrapyard, and uses it to attack several Klingon colony worlds, threatening the recent d&eacute;tente between the Empire and Federation. The <em>Odyssey</em>'s pursuit of the rogue ship is particularly personal to Zhang, as Matthews's gross negligence was responsible for the friendly fire incident that decimated the Starfleet garrison at the Battle of Korvat Colony eight years ago. Complicating matters is Matthew's abduction of <em>Odyssey</em> Chief Engineer K'vov, who is being forced to help repair the <em>Titan</em> before its reaches its next target - the Klingon Defense Force headquarters at Ty'Gokor.</p>

While Remara works with his counterparts to upgrade other ships in the Task Force with the now-perfected Quantum Slipstream Drive, Richardson and Ong welcome the newest additions to the <em>Odyssey</em>'s crew - the Voth defector Nelen Exil, now a civilian Federation science consultant, as well as an Engineer transferring from the Bajoran militia <span class="spoiler">- the real Krim Nala</span>.</p>

				During routine maintenance of the the <em>Odyssey</em>'s holodecks, Ensigns Krim, Akorem and Helna accidentally lock themselves inside a test program where holographic duplicates of Helna run amok. When Remara and K'vov's attempts to extract them are impeded by the increasingly aggressive holocharacters, the <em>Odyssey</em> requests assistance from the nearby USS <em>Alacrity</em>, captained by Helna's ex-boyfriend Jirgou Neyuque. It is eventually discovered that a comet being examined by the <em>Odyssey</em> at the time of the holodeck accident is the home of an unknown species of photonic lifeforms, who hijacked the holoprogram to seek help in saving their home from being destroyed by a nearby star.</p>
